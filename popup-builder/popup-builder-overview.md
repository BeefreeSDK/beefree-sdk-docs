# Popup Builder overview

Many digital marketing campaigns start with an attention-grabbing popup. In fact, many such campaigns include a popup, a landing page, and one or more emails.

* A cool popup highlights something that the reader may be interested in
* A landing page provides more information and includes some sort of signup form
* Emails are sent to follow up.

Emails, pages, popups: three pillars of all sorts of digital marketing initiatives. Since **Email Builder** and **Page Builder** were already part of the Beefree SDK family, the natural next step was to create a **Popup Builder**. So here it is! This new version of the builder brings effortless popup creation inside your application.\


A popup is a small window that appears on a website visitor’s screen, asking for an email address in the most basic interaction or other actionable messages when using more sophisticated strategies (targeted promotions, social evidence messages, shopping cart recovery, etc.).

Popups are one of the most used online marketing tools. When done right, they capture visitors’ attention at the right moment, and push them forward in the customer journey. Despite attracting criticism in the past because they create a barrier between visitors and content, there’s plenty of evidence that they work. They will continue to play a strong part in any modern-day marketing strategy. [Read our blog entry](https://dam.beefree.io/popupblog) if you’re interested in learning more.

With this in mind, we have developed an embeddable solution for designing popups that you can easily deploy because:

* it’s built from the ground up to integrate seamlessly with your application;
* it’s easy to use, offers tons of design flexibility, and builds upon the same UX your customers already know from our Email & Page Builders;
* all data stays in your application, and you don’t have to ask your customers to use 3rd party tools for building popups. You can leverage our [Form block](https://docs.beefree.io/working-with-forms/) to add forms to popups

### Sample workflow <a href="#sample-workflow" id="sample-workflow"></a>

In terms of packaging the final output, Beefree SDK takes care of the Popup design and returns a solid HTML output ready to be injected on a website. On top of that, you can enrich the building experience by creating a workflow that will add to that output:

* Showing/closing behavior (e.g. display after N seconds, exit intent)
* “Additional” styles, for things like
  * Close button
  * Border radius
  * Drop shadows

The good thing: you can pass additional styles to your application, so they will reflect into the editing experience. You will then take the HTML produced by Beefree SDK and apply these styles for the final output.
