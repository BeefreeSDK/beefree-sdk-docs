# Contribute to the Partner AddOn Marketplace

## Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

Partner AddOns can easily be integrated with your application in a matter of minutes by installing them inside of the [Developer Console](https://developers.beefree.io/accounts/login/?from=website\_menu). You can reference available Partner AddOns inside of the [Partner AddOn Directory](../partner-addons/partner-addons-directory.md). If the AddOn with the functionality you are looking for is not offered within the Partner Directory, you also have the option to create your own [Custom AddOn](./). If you'd like to add your Custom AddOn to Partner AddOn Marketplace within the Beefree SDK Developer Console, you have the option to do that.&#x20;

Throughout this page, we will discuss at a high-level how you can list the Custom AddOn you created as a Partner AddOns within the Partner AddOn Marketplace. &#x20;

## Getting started <a href="#getting-started" id="getting-started"></a>

To get started, you will need to follow the [AddOn Development](addon-development.md) documentation and create a Custom AddOn for a  web application that has embedded Beefree SDK.

Please note that because Partner AddOns by definition live outside of the Beefree SDK application that will use them, you must select the **external iframe** method for development.

## Listing in the partner directory <a href="#listing-in-the-partner-directory" id="listing-in-the-partner-directory"></a>

You can submit your AddOn to be listed in the Beefree SDK Partner AddOn Directory, so that other applications that have embedded Beefree SDK can take advantage of it.

You will be completely in charge of the business relationship with those companies, who will become your customers. We are not part of that relationship, other than being an enabler of it.

The following is a list of requirements for getting an AddOn listed in the Partner AddOn Directory:

1. You have signed the Beefree SDK AddOn License and Distribution Agreement. Contact your Account Manager or log in to the [Beefree SDK Console](https://dam.beefree.io/devmain) and submit a ticket for details.
2. You have built an AddOn that:
   1. Uses the External iFrame Method (see [AddOn Development](addon-development.md))
   2. Uses the optional health check endpoint
3. You have thoroughly tested the AddOn before submitting it to our test for a final review.
4. You have a demo of the AddOn that we can access.

When you have completed all of the above, contact your Account Manager or log in to the [Developer Portal](https://dam.beefree.io/devmain) and submit a ticket to complete the review and approval process.
