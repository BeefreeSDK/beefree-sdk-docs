# Partner AddOns

{% hint style="info" %}
Partner AddOns are available for [Beefree SDK paid plan types](https://developers.beefree.io/pricing-plans).
{% endhint %}

## What are Partner AddOns? <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

Partner AddOns can easily be integrated with your application in a matter of minutes by installing them inside of the [Developer Console](https://developers.beefree.io/accounts/login/?from=website_menu). You can reference available Partner AddOns inside of the [Partner AddOn Directory](partner-addons-directory.md). If the AddOn with the functionality you are looking for is not offered within the Partner Directory, you also have the option to create your own [Custom AddOn](../custom-addons/).

At a high-level, these AddOns enable you to add extended functionality and capabilities to your application. These extended functionalities empower you to customize your end users' experience based on their interests and the desired tasks they are trying to perform with your app. The AddOns work as additional features you can opt in for on top of the base features that come with your [Beefree SDK plan type](https://developers.beefree.io/pricing-plans).

## Where can I find the Partner AddOns Marketplace?

You can find the Partner AddOns Marketplace within the [Beefree SDK Developer Console](https://developers.beefree.io/accounts/login/?from=website_menu).

Take the following steps to access the Partner AddOns Marketplace:

1. Log in to your [Developer Console](https://developers.beefree.io/accounts/login/?from=website_menu).
2. Navigate to the application you'd like to add a Partner AddOn to.
3. Click on the **Details** button.
4.  Navigate to **AddOns** and click **View more**.

    You'll be redirected to the AddOns page.
5. Click on the **Browse AddOns** button.
6. You'll be redirected to the Marketplace with the available AddOns.

## How soon is the functionality available to my end users?

Once you successfully install a Partner AddOn following the steps outlined in [Installing Partner AddOns](installing-partner-addons.md), it will be available to your application's end users. Depending on the AddOn, you may or may not apply configuration settings to manage the functionality of the AddOn. For example, you may want to apply configurations to AI-related AddOns to control tokens and associated costs.&#x20;
