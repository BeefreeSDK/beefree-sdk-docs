# Email Builder

**Beefree SDK** started out in 2015 as an **embeddable**, **drag-&-drop email editor**. It was first embedded in [beefree.io](https://beefree.io/?utm\_source=docs\&utm\_medium=website\&utm\_campaign=building-emails-page) and then in **hundreds of SaaS applications** around the globe, across all sorts of industries: from marketing automation to event engagement; from restaurant management to a CRM for dentists ðŸ™‚

**Beefree SDK Email Builder** aims to be the best email editor on the market, ready to be embedded and bring awesome email creation inside web applications. It features a unique combination of **design flexibility** and **ease of use**, coupled with great freedom in how you can integrate it into your application.

In 2020, guided by the same principles, we launched [**Page Builder**](https://docs.beefree.io/page-builder-overview/), another embeddable product for creating beautiful, responsive landing pages, without writing a single line of code.

Now Beefree SDK is both an Email and a Page Builder: as these two products share the same core capabilities and features, the **documentation** in this site **applies to both**, unless otherwise specified. If this is your first approach to our builders, just follow the [Getting Started](https://docs.beefree.io/initializing-bee-plugin/) section in our documentation.
