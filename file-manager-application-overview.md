### Managing assets with File Manager <a href="#managing-assets-with-file-manager" id="managing-assets-with-file-manager"></a>

The File Manager can be launched as a standalone application. This means that users can access the File Manager directly, without having to first launch the builder application. This is useful for situations where a user needs to quickly upload or manage assets, but doesn’t need to create a full email, landing page, or popup.

This can make the asset management process more streamlined and efficient, which can ultimately help users be more productive.

### Testing and integrating the File Manager <a href="#testing-and-integrating-the-file-manager" id="testing-and-integrating-the-file-manager"></a>

When you create an application in the [Beefree SDK Console](https://dam.beefree.io/devmain), you’ll have the option to create a File Manager application.

Paid applications also include the option to create child development applications. These child applications can be used for new feature testing, development, and maintenance. By creating a child application, developers can easily test and iterate on new features without affecting the main application. This can help to minimize downtime and reduce the risk of introducing bugs or errors into the production environment.

The child applications can also be used for ongoing maintenance and updates. Instead of making changes directly to the production environment, developers can make updates and improvements in the child application, test them thoroughly, and then deploy the changes to the main application once they have been fully vetted. This can help to ensure that the main application remains stable and functional, even as new features and updates are introduced.

File manager applications **share the same core functionalities** as all other builders. These functionalities include authentication and configuration, which are necessary for the development process. If you have already integrated another builder into your workflow, you can easily re-use most of your work by using **the same configuration** for the file manager application.

For those who are new to our platform, our documentation includes a comprehensive [Getting Started](https://docs.beefree.io/initializing-bee-plugin/) section that provides detailed instructions on how to set up and use our builders. This section is applicable to all products.

File Manager and all builders are available to  customers under the same [**all-in-one pricing.**](https://dam.beefree.io/pluginpricing) Please contact your Customer Success Manager for more details.
