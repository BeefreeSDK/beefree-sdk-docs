# Hosted Saved Rows

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature is available on Beefree SDK [Core plan](https://dam.beefree.io/pluginpricing) and above.
{% endhint %}

## **Overview**

Hosted Saved Rows offers a fully managed solution, eliminating the need to set up and maintain backend systems. With this option, Beefree SDK handles storage, security, scaling, and updates, allowing your team to focus on delivering a great user experience. In addition to managing storage, this option also provides you with a [ready-to-go user interface](hosted-saved-rows.md#ready-to-go-user-interface) made available to your application's end users through a toggle in the [Developer Console](https://developers.beefree.io/accounts/login/?from=website_menu).&#x20;

This [ready-to-go UI](hosted-saved-rows.md#ready-to-go-user-interface) enables application end users to:

* Save a row and make it available for reuse in the future.
* Add new saved row categories to organize the rows they save.
* Edit a saved row's existing name and category.
* Delete a saved row.
* Update existing saved rows with the option to save them as new saved rows.&#x20;

### **Key Benefits**

* Fully managed by Beefree SDK, and activated through a toggle in the Developer Console.
* Ideal for teams that want a quick setup without maintaining backend systems.
* Offers centralized storage, security, and reliability, while also providing a user interface to save and  reuse rows within your application.
* Allows for advanced controls through configuring [Advanced Permissions for Hosted Saved Rows](../../other-customizations/advanced-options/advanced-permissions.md#hosted-saved-rows).

#### What is a Hosted Saved Row? <a href="#what-is-a-hosted-row" id="what-is-a-hosted-row"></a>

Beefree SDK has introduced an updated version of the popular Saved Rows feature called Hosted Saved Rows. With this feature, Beefree SDK is responsible for storing Saved Rows in its own S3 Bucket and handling all the necessary steps for allowing your users to save and reuse rows.

#### What are the biggest benefits of this feature for your end users? <a href="#what-are-the-biggest-benefits-of-this-feature-for-your-end-users" id="what-are-the-biggest-benefits-of-this-feature-for-your-end-users"></a>

End users can now easily save and reuse rows across multiple designs, including emails, pages, and popups. They can quickly find and manage Hosted Saved Rows by category.

#### What is the difference between Hosted Saved Rows and Self-Hosted Saved Rows? <a href="#what-is-the-difference-between-hosted-rows-and-saved-rows" id="what-is-the-difference-between-hosted-rows-and-saved-rows"></a>

The benefit for your users remains the sameâ€”they can save and reuse rows instead of rebuilding them every time. The only difference is that with Hosted Saved Rows, you don't have to develop all the necessary steps within your application on your own. All you need to do is activate the feature through a toggle in the [Developer Console](https://developers.beefree.io/accounts/login/?from=website_menu).

#### Where are the Hosted Saved Rows stored? <a href="#where-are-the-hosted-rows-stored" id="where-are-the-hosted-rows-stored"></a>

We will store your end users' Hosted Saved Rows in a Beefree S3 Bucket. Each row will be exclusively used for the given UID belonging to the subscription.
