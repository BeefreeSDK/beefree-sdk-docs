# Storage for Reusable Content

## Hosting Options Overview

Saved Rows in Beefree SDK empower users to save, reuse, and organize design elements efficiently, which optimizes the creation process for emails, pages, and popups. With Saved Rows, users can categorize rows by themes or criteria, ensuring easy access and consistency across projects.

Beefree SDK offers two hosting options: [Hosted Saved Rows](./#hosted-saved-rows) and [Self-Hosted Saved Rows](./#self-hosted-saved-rows). Each option has unique advantages suited to specific organizational needs, resources, and technical requirements. This guide compares the options, helping you choose the best fit for your team.

## Hosted Saved Rows

Hosted Saved Rows offers a fully managed solution, eliminating the need to set up and maintain backend systems. With this option, Beefree SDK handles storage, security, scaling, and updates, allowing your team to focus on delivering a great user experience. In addition to managing storage, this option also provides you with a ready-to-go user interface made available to your application's end users by default.&#x20;

This ready-to-go UI enables application end users to:

* Save a row and make it available for reuse in the future
* Add new saved row categories to organize the rows they save
* Edit a saved row's existing name and category
* Delete a saved row
* Update existing saved rows with the option to save them as new saved rows&#x20;

### **Key Benefits**

* Fully managed by Beefree SDK, and available by default for Core applications and above.
* Ideal for teams that want a quick setup without maintaining backend systems.
* Offers centralized storage, security, and reliability, while also providing a user interface to save and  reuse rows within your application.

## Self-Hosted Saved Rows

Self-Hosted Saved Rows gives teams complete control over how Saved Rows are stored, managed, and secured. This option is best for organizations with specific compliance or integration requirements, and those with the resources to manage backend systems effectively.

### **Key Benefits**

* Allows full control over where and how rows are stored.
* Suitable for teams with specific compliance or integration needs.
* Requires development resources for managing row storage, and creating a user interface to manage and reuse rows.

## Self-Hosted vs. Hosted Saved Rows

Both options allow end users to save and reuse rows on the frontend, but the best hosting option for your team will depend on your priorities concerning setup complexity, development resources (for storage and building a UI), and ongoing maintenance.
