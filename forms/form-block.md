# Form Block

## Overview of Form Block

The Form Block allows you to integrate no-code form creation within your implementation of Beefree SDK. This is helpful in scenarios where your application's end users may want to add forms to their [page](../visual-builders/page-builder/integrating-page-builder.md) or [popup](../visual-builders/popup-builder/) designs.

Forms are an important part of the content creation workflow, because they enable your end users to gather important information and data relevant to their campaigns and workflows. This data can then be used for future targeted campaigns, personalized content, and so on.

There are several ways you can integrate the Form Block within Beefree SDK to provide your end users with a customized experience that is tailored to their use cases and needs. A few of these customizations and use cases are the following:

*   [Configure a default form](https://github.com/BeefreeSDK/beefree-sdk-form-block-demo/blob/main/default-form-example.html) within the Form Block that your end users can then drag-and-drop onto the stage and edit.

*   [Create a Form library](https://github.com/BeefreeSDK/beefree-sdk-form-block-demo/blob/main/form-library-example.html) using the Form Block that your end users can use to browse Form templates, select their favorite one, and edit it within the builder.

*   [Implement a Form Builder](https://app.gitbook.com/o/hABGoPMOKISmuDmz4fbV/s/xZgBDrdhQLtWmkGqVR59/) that your end users can use to build their own custom form, load them into their page or popup design, and edit as needed.

You can find sample projects for each of these scenarios in the [Form Block Demo GitHub repository](https://github.com/BeefreeSDK/beefree-sdk-form-block-demo/tree/main). You can also find the [Form validation schema](https://github.com/BeefreeSDK/beefree-sdk-sample-forms/tree/master/validation%20schema) and [sample forms](https://github.com/BeefreeSDK/beefree-sdk-sample-forms/tree/master/forms) in this [Sample Forms GitHub repository](https://github.com/BeefreeSDK/beefree-sdk-sample-forms).
