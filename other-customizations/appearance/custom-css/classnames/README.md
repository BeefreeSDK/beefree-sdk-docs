# Classnames

## Classnames Overview <a href="#sample-custom-css-theme" id="sample-custom-css-theme"></a>

Classnames are identifiers applied to HTML elements that help you target them for styling, functionality, or accessibility. When you assign a classname to an element, it allows you to customize its appearance using CSS or interact with it through JavaScript. This separation of structure and styling is a key principle of web development, enabling you to build flexible and maintainable code. By organizing your styles through classnames, you can ensure consistency across your site or application, and quickly make updates without touching the HTML structure.

Using classnames for custom CSS is a powerful way to control the visual presentation of your web application. You can define how elements like buttons, forms, or menus look across various devices and screen sizes. Classnames give you granular control over design details like colors, spacing, and fonts, allowing for a cohesive user experience. Beyond aesthetics, proper use of classnames can enhance the performance of your site by minimizing the need for inline styling, making it easier to manage and maintain.

Classnames also play a critical role in making your web application accessible. By combining CSS classnames with semantic HTML elements, you can create user-friendly experiences for diverse audiences. Screen readers and other assistive technologies rely on well-structured HTML and accessible classnames to interpret content correctly. This ensures that your application is usable by a wider audience, improving your reach and inclusivity. Accessible web design not only benefits users but also contributes to better SEO and legal compliance, making it a vital aspect of modern web development.
