# Custom JavaScript Libraries Injection

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature is available on the [Beefree SDK Enterprise plan](https://developers.beefree.io/pricing-plans).
{% endhint %}

## Custom JavaScript

Enterprise customers can request to inject external JavaScript libraries, like FullStory or Heap, into Beefree SDK when the integration is initialized as part of the [server-side configuration](../../getting-started/readme/installation/).&#x20;

Custom JavaScript requires a complete technical evaluation by the Beefree SDK development team. The assessment will undergo security, technical and compatibility assessments. &#x20;

## How it Works

Contact our Sales team and ask to run a script to get started with custom JS libraries injection. Once you contact us, we will take the following steps to complete your request:

1. Our representative will forward your request to our development team &#x20;
2. The development team will review the script and approve it
3. The script is enabled by our development team
