{% hint style="info" %}
This feature is available for all [Beefree SDK plan types](https://developers.beefree.io/pricing-plans). Available for Email Builder, Page Builder, and Popup Builder.
{% endhint %}

## Overview

The **Cards Style** feature allows you to transform ordinary messages into visually appealing layouts that grab your audience’s attention effortlessly. Using stylish cards, you can highlight your product features, display customer testimonials, promote special offers, and present news updates in a structured and eye-catching manner. This enhances the readability and engagement of your emails or landing pages, ensuring that important information stands out and resonates with your viewers.

On the other hand, the **Image Round Corners** feature provides a subtle yet effective way to add a modern touch to your visuals. By applying rounded corners to images directly from the side panel, you can enhance the overall aesthetic of your content without the need for additional tools. This feature helps create a sleek, professional look that can make your emails or landing pages more visually appealing and current.

Together, these features empower your application’s end-users to create more compelling and attractive messages effortlessly. Whether it's showcasing products, sharing testimonials, or offering promotions, users can employ these stylistic options to make their content more engaging and easier to scan. These design enhancements not only improve the visual appeal but also help in effectively conveying key messages to the audience.
