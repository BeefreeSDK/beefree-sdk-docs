00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:26,760
it is part of one of the three key pillars of 
our product and that is design Excellence we have

4
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,840
customers that range from large corporations like 
like Microsoft Dell Iron Mountain that have very

5
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,560
strict brand guidelines and they have to reproduce 
the same quality of landing pages and emails as

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:46,960
they do with their corporate tools we also have 
small teams that have very limited resources or

7
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,360
experience and they needed a tool that was easy 
to use the reason we chose to use the B free

8
00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:00,040
SDK was I knew that it had the best-in-class 
design tools it was well thought out for a

9
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:06,120
a user scenario where you're in a SAS environment 
and having lots of clients of various different

10
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:15,440
skill sets using the tool within 4 days we had 
uh proof of concept put in place we were Fully

the product it was a very quick process with

12
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,680
very small amount of engineering effort the B 
free SDK is great because we can continually add

13
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,560
additional features to make our customers 
lives easier things like saved rows where

14
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,960
they can Auto insert their logo they can add 
their boilerplate messaging that they might

15
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,400
be required by you know corporate counsel it's 
really easy to underestimate the needs of your

16
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:52,240
customers having a tool that's both easy to use 
and has the breadth of feature set you're going

17
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:59,000
to reap rewards not only in the sales side of 
the equation but also in the support savings

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,920
and then finally of course your engineering cost 
I've used a lot of products over the years and
