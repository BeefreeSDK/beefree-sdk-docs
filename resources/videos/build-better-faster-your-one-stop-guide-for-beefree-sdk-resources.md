0:00:00.240,0:00:05.520
Good morning, all! Good morning, all! Real 
quick check before we get started. I think

0:00:05.520,0:00:10.000
I have one minute or 30 seconds left. 
Is my audio okay? Am I totally audible,

0:00:10.000,0:00:16.240
clear? Is the audio okay? You all are my 
test engineers. I see thumbs up! Thank

0:00:16.240,0:00:20.080
you for the thumbs up. Good to go. Just 
to be sure, I'm going to turn off this

0:00:20.080,0:00:26.800
fan. Don't want any interruptions. And 
it is 11 Central, so let's get started.

0:00:26.800,0:00:31.280
Good morning, and good afternoon, and good 
evening to our global audience from Beefree

0:00:31.280,0:00:35.120
SDK! My name is Lawrence Lockhart, and 
I'm the host of our spotlight session

0:00:35.120,0:00:39.520
today that has everything to do with the 
Beefree SDK, but even more importantly,

0:00:39.520,0:00:44.800
the Beefree SDK resources for developers. Now, 
while I'm going through the intro, feel free—I

0:00:44.800,0:00:48.480
see some of you are already doing it—just say 
hi in the chat. Let us know your name and where

0:00:48.480,0:00:52.640
you're from. I love to shout out hometowns, and 
uh, we like to say hi to you in that fashion.

0:00:52.640,0:00:57.360
But today is a very special session. Simple 
agenda: The first half of our day-to-day, we're

0:00:57.360,0:01:01.360
going to look at resources for developers that 
are currently existing, right? Primarily, these

0:01:01.360,0:01:07.040
are all online resources. But the second half is 
where it gets really juicy, really exciting: We're

0:01:07.040,0:01:11.440
going to open up the floor to you, the developer 
community. We want to know what you would like

0:01:11.440,0:01:17.680
to see from us in terms of resources available. 
It might be a tweak to an existing resource, it

0:01:17.680,0:01:22.960
might be something that's just not used anymore, 
it's cumbersome, maybe it's a workflow—anything

0:01:22.960,0:01:27.600
that can make your life better as a developer, we 
would like to hear from you in the second half.

0:01:27.600,0:01:30.240
And if you're brand new to Beefree, 
you've never touched it before,

0:01:30.240,0:01:33.760
you don't even know what it is, feel free 
at that point just to add in the chat,

0:01:33.760,0:01:38.320
'Hey, here's some things I'd like to see when it 
comes to Beefree, when it comes to documentation,

0:01:38.320,0:01:42.320
when it comes to onboarding, when it comes to 
support.' Let us know those things down in the

0:01:42.320,0:01:45.840
chat. We would love to hear from you. 
This is a recorded session. Of course,

0:01:45.840,0:01:50.240
it'll be available on our YouTube within a few 
days. We'll be able to go back and get all of your

0:01:50.240,0:01:54.160
feedback and hear what you're having to say, what 
changes you would like to see. We're going to make

0:01:54.160,0:01:58.880
note of those and get those information—those 
information back to the appropriate party.

0:01:58.880,0:02:04.960
So, in the meantime, we have Joshua Berrios, great 
to see Joshua. He is a good friend of mine. We go

0:02:04.960,0:02:12.000
back, um, to interviews, to podcasts, to tech 
Twitter. Uh, 'Good day from sunny Florida.'

0:02:12.000,0:02:18.320
Samantha Hoffman, she is the marketing genius, 
keeps me on my toes. Great to see her smiling

0:02:18.320,0:02:23.280
face virtually. Shares Rucker, glad to have 
you here from parts unknown. Jake Olsen,

0:02:23.280,0:02:27.200
also glad to have you here. Welcome this morning 
or afternoon. Don't know where you're from. We

0:02:27.200,0:02:31.840
do have a global audience and customer 
base. Uh, Joshua hailing from Lincoln,

0:02:31.840,0:02:35.440
Nebraska, product developer at Code Buddy. 
Awesome, awesome! Thank you for that,

0:02:35.440,0:02:40.400
Joshua. We need to get together again soon. 
I've got a hello from Little Rock, Arkansas,

0:02:40.400,0:02:46.320
very close to me, probably the close person award. 
I'm hailing from the Memphis, Tennessee area. Uh,

0:02:46.320,0:02:51.600
fun fact: The first tech meetup I ever attended 
was in Little Rock, Jeremy, back when I was just

0:02:51.600,0:02:55.280
making my transition into tech. And there 
was nothing around my neighborhood. I did

0:02:55.280,0:03:01.040
a Google search, and there was a boot camp 
called Ironyard back then in Little Rock,

0:03:01.040,0:03:04.800
and they had a Saturday, like, a three or 
four-hour meetup session, 'Getting Started

0:03:04.800,0:03:10.720
with HTML,' something like that. And I drove from 
Oxford, Mississippi, to—to Little Rock, Arkansas,

0:03:10.720,0:03:16.880
for that one session. So glad to have you here. 
Jake hailing from Oregon. All good. I have been

0:03:16.880,0:03:23.040
to Oregon only once—beautiful place. Share hailing 
from Buford, Georgia. Shout out to all of you!

0:03:23.040,0:03:27.920
Let's go ahead and get started. And again, those 
of you who have joined, there are about 16 people

0:03:27.920,0:03:31.040
here all together. Feel free just to say hi 
real quick in the chat, where you're from,

0:03:31.040,0:03:36.400
if you like. And if not, definitely participate 
toward the end of our session today. So,

0:03:36.400,0:03:40.000
like I said, today is a really special session 
because we're going to look at existing resources,

0:03:40.000,0:03:44.640
but also resources you would like to see. Now, my 
position is Senior Developer Advocate. I am the

0:03:44.640,0:03:49.760
only Developer Advocate or DevRel here at Beefree, 
and I've been here for less than three months. So

0:03:49.760,0:03:55.120
much of the program is still being written, and 
we want you, the developer community—both those

0:03:55.120,0:03:59.360
who are engaged in the Beefree ecosystem as 
well as those who are on the outside and just

0:03:59.360,0:04:04.640
curious—we want you to have a part, we want you 
to be an active voice in shaping the programs,

0:04:04.640,0:04:09.280
the resources, the assets that we're going to 
put out in the upcoming weeks and months. We have

0:04:09.280,0:04:14.240
some exciting things in the pipeline already. 
Just sent some goals and some tasks to my man,

0:04:14.240,0:04:18.560
to my manager, Luca Pinani, and, uh, we 
want you to be able to input to those

0:04:18.560,0:04:24.720
goals and give us some feedback as well. So 
let's get started. If I do this correctly,

0:04:24.720,0:04:38.400
I should be able to do a picture-in-picture 
and share this screen right here with you.

0:04:38.400,0:04:44.480
Alrighty, let's just get a thumbs up if you see 
the homepage right there. Just a quick thumbs up,

0:04:44.480,0:04:49.200
and we're going to keep on moving. Want to 
make sure everything is sharing accurately.

0:04:49.200,0:04:56.640
Thumbs up, yes, anything of that 
nature. Do you see my homepage?

0:04:56.640,0:05:00.160
Yes! Awesome! Thank you so much, Sherise. Thank 
you, Mandel. Welcome, Mandel Gordon. Glad to

0:05:00.160,0:05:05.520
have you! Alright, so as a developer, this is 
the homepage for the entire company, Beefree.

0:05:05.520,0:05:09.280
But more than likely, as a developer, you're 
more interested in the SDK, specifically the

0:05:09.280,0:05:14.480
Software Development Kit that will allow you to 
embed our very powerful editor into your existing

0:05:14.480,0:05:22.400
application. So right here where it says 'Dev,' 
this is going to be your home base. And naturally,

0:05:22.400,0:05:31.520
it's not cooperating with me. Alright, because why 
would anything live work, right? I'm having—say

0:05:31.520,0:05:38.240
what? Let's turn off. Oh, wow, didn't expect that. 
So, you know what, we're going to just exit page.

0:05:38.240,0:05:42.320
That's okay, because in fact, the most powerful 
resource that I'm going to talk to you about,

0:05:42.320,0:05:47.440
first of all, is myself. Hi again, I'm Lawrence 
Lockhart, Developer Advocate. And developer

0:05:47.440,0:05:52.560
advocacy is a very interesting role because it 
has two sides of a coin. Many of you may know

0:05:52.560,0:05:56.480
of developer advocates and think of them in terms 
of, 'Oh, that's the people I typically see on the

0:05:56.480,0:06:01.600
videos, that's the people giving the talks at the 
local tech meetup, maybe at the conference.' And

0:06:01.600,0:06:07.840
that's certainly a really big part of our output: 
advocating, if you will, or representing our

0:06:07.840,0:06:12.000
company to the developer community at large. 
That's a huge part of our job. But there's

0:06:12.000,0:06:16.640
another part, the other side of the coin that 
I call it, and that is bringing your concerns,

0:06:16.640,0:06:21.280
your interests, back to the company. Think 
about it this way: If you've ever thought about

0:06:21.280,0:06:26.320
a new software that you use, a new tool, a new 
framework, language even, you thought to yourself,

0:06:26.320,0:06:30.560
'If I just had someone on the inside I could 
talk to, this could be so much better. If I could

0:06:30.560,0:06:35.120
just get someone to listen to me, and I'm raising 
issues in the GitHub and no one's responding, I'm

0:06:35.120,0:06:39.840
sending emails. I wish I had someone on the inside 
that I could not necessarily just complain to,

0:06:39.840,0:06:44.160
but give some feedback about some of the tools, 
some of the software that we're using, things that

0:06:44.160,0:06:49.040
are going well, things that are not going so well. 
I wish I had someone on the inside to advocate for

0:06:49.040,0:06:56.880
me.' Ta-da! Here I am. I am he for Beefree. Now, 
to be clear, if you're talking plans and pricing,

0:06:56.880,0:07:01.360
you have account managers for that. If you're 
talking hot button issues, production down,

0:07:01.360,0:07:06.640
right, 3:00 AM in the morning, you have CSMs for 
that. Maybe, yes, you have CSMs for that. But

0:07:06.640,0:07:09.840
when you just need to nerd out about something, 
or if you see something that's not quite right

0:07:09.840,0:07:13.280
with the documentation, if you see something 
that can be a little bit better, that can make

0:07:13.280,0:07:18.640
your developer experience—that's a big key phrase 
these days, developer experience—that it could be

0:07:18.640,0:07:23.520
a little better, I want you to reach out to me. 
So feel free just to follow me on LinkedIn. Here,

0:07:23.520,0:07:28.400
if you do X or Twitter, it'll be the same little 
funny yellow background, the same smiling face. My

0:07:28.400,0:07:34.720
name is Lawrence Lockhart. Connect with me. I am 
happy—I have done this many times—to engage via DM

0:07:34.720,0:07:39.120
with things that you're experiencing, things that 
you're going well, that you want to see continued,

0:07:39.120,0:07:43.840
like, 'Hey, I love how y'all did the Readme on 
this latest integration with Angular. Please

0:07:43.840,0:07:47.440
do all the rest of them like this.' We want to 
hear that. We want to get that feedback from you,

0:07:47.440,0:07:51.120
and I'll get that information to the 
appropriate sources. So number one resource

0:07:51.120,0:07:56.720
I want to recommend to you is myself, Lawrence 
Lockhart. Love for you to engage with me there.

0:07:56.720,0:08:00.560
Now, let's try this again, because earlier 
it didn't cooperate, maybe just too many tabs

0:08:00.560,0:08:04.800
open. So this is the overall homepage, 
but I think most likely, there we go,

0:08:04.800,0:08:10.160
this is the page as a developer you'll be most 
interested in. This is your developer hub. It has

0:08:10.160,0:08:14.640
so much information. It's a great starting place, 
particularly if you're not in the ecosystem yet,

0:08:14.640,0:08:19.040
you're not even sure where to start. The homepage 
obviously is for our whole company. The SDK,

0:08:19.040,0:08:24.640
that's got the developer in mind. The SDK, the 
developer page: developers.beefree.io. Now,

0:08:24.640,0:08:28.000
as we scroll through this, you'll realize it 
has a lot of information that's great when you

0:08:28.000,0:08:31.920
want to share what is Beefree with someone 
else, because maybe you've been using it,

0:08:31.920,0:08:36.160
you want to suggest it to another company, 
another team, you're not sure where to send

0:08:36.160,0:08:41.280
them on our vast website. This is a great place 
to go because you will find case studies, you

0:08:41.280,0:08:46.000
will find high-level information about the email 
builder, landing page builder, pop-up builder,

0:08:46.000,0:08:50.880
file manager, content services API, template 
catalog API. Of course, you know we have the HTML

0:08:50.880,0:08:57.440
importer API as well. But you'll find results, 
KPIs that have landed at various customers.

0:08:57.440,0:09:03.840
You can share with other people. This is your 
central hub for developers: developers.beefree.io.

0:09:03.840,0:09:07.200
Now, before we get into all these links—I'm not 
going to go through all of them—but I wanted

0:09:07.200,0:09:11.920
to direct your attention to something that's 
really, really exciting down here. This is Bix,

0:09:11.920,0:09:20.080
and Bix is our AI-powered search. I love it! 
I love it! I love it! 99.7, 99.9% of the time,

0:09:20.080,0:09:25.200
it has absolutely knocked it out of the park 
for me. We're going to try a live question here,

0:09:25.200,0:09:28.480
a live prompt. So, y'all pray for 
me if you don't mind. Let's just,

0:09:28.480,0:09:37.120
uh, close that real quick, and, 
uh, okay, doing way too much.

0:09:37.120,0:09:50.000
Can we type, 'How'—oh, wow, 
let's just try this again.

0:09:50.000,0:09:57.760
Something in the sharing is not—there 
we go. 'How do I create an add-on?'

0:09:57.760,0:10:03.760
And this is going to do an AI search throughout 
our documentation and throughout all of our

0:10:03.760,0:10:09.040
information on the website to see how do you 
create an add-on. I said, 'Ask it again,'

0:10:09.040,0:10:21.600
because of course, I tested this earlier, 
'Please share the full process once again.'

0:10:21.600,0:10:24.480
And we're going to give it just a moment, but 
I definitely want to let you know that this

0:10:24.480,0:10:28.720
AI-powered assistant is live, it is out of 
beta, it is available for you. And here we

0:10:28.720,0:10:31.760
get the steps. Let's just check to make sure 
they're right. 'Log in to the console.' That

0:10:31.760,0:10:35.920
is accurate. 'Create your development app.' 
That'll be accurate as well. 'Navigate to the

0:10:35.920,0:10:40.800
application configuration, click on details.' 
You have to have a Superpowers plan or above.

0:10:40.800,0:10:46.240
'Select on add-ons, then click Create Custom 
Add-on,' and go from there. And in this case,

0:10:46.240,0:10:50.320
it even gave us a link for the documentation 
relevant to that. So that was fantastic.

0:10:50.320,0:10:55.920
Definitely want to use the AI-powered 
search down here. It's called Bix.

0:10:55.920,0:11:00.080
Now, from there, let's go up to some of 
our links up top. Here we see 'Toolkit'

0:11:00.080,0:11:04.720
with a dropdown. I think I need to close this 
first. Excellent. 'Toolkit' with a dropdown,

0:11:04.720,0:11:11.040
'Solutions.' I want to look at 'Docs.' I think 
this is my personal opinion only, our docs are

0:11:11.040,0:11:17.120
some of the most powerful and efficient assets 
that we have in the entire ecosystem of resources

0:11:17.120,0:11:22.960
for developers. We have a single technical writer, 
Zire Ortiz. I give him constant props for the work

0:11:22.960,0:11:27.680
that he has done, because in the documentation, 
obviously we're going to go through, we're going

0:11:27.680,0:11:31.920
to get right to our getting started guide 
here, our quick start guide. I've done this

0:11:31.920,0:11:36.880
multiple times. It's straightforward, it works 
as is. Uh, then we go over to the left here,

0:11:36.880,0:11:41.600
we see 'Creating an Application,' 'Installation 
Fundamentals,' 'Development Applications,' 'How

0:11:41.600,0:11:45.760
to Manage Users and Subscriptions.' And then as 
we go down here, we see the different builders.

0:11:45.760,0:11:50.000
As many of you know, we have three different 
builders: one for email, one for landing pages,

0:11:50.000,0:11:55.520
one for pop-ups. Descriptions for all those right 
here on the left navigation. We also have these

0:11:55.520,0:11:59.920
APIs to really extend the functionality of 
your editor. So the Content Services API,

0:11:59.920,0:12:04.480
Template Catalog, and HTML Importer. You can 
access all those right here, at least information

0:12:04.480,0:12:11.760
about them right here. Information about forms, 
reusable rows, file manager, and other features,

0:12:11.760,0:12:17.760
all available from this left panel within the 
documentation. So big props to Zire Ortiz,

0:12:17.760,0:12:22.400
constantly adding on. I just saw another site 
message from this morning, some more updates,

0:12:22.400,0:12:27.920
very much up-to-date, very helpful for developers. 
I'm going to get out of the docs. We're going to

0:12:27.920,0:12:32.560
go back over here, and I do see a question. Just 
to keep myself focused, I'm going to come to your

0:12:32.560,0:12:35.840
questions toward the end if that's okay. I want 
to make sure I get all through this because we

0:12:35.840,0:12:40.320
only have 30 minutes together. Um, but I do see 
your question. Thank you very much for that.

0:12:40.320,0:12:45.040
So from the docs, I want to go to what—I want to 
go to next? I want to go to 'Support.' So let's

0:12:45.040,0:12:51.360
just go to support.beefree.io. Of course, it's 
cached, and what you'll see here is a slightly

0:12:51.360,0:12:56.480
different look. Um, this search right here is 
not an AI-powered search. This will be a standard

0:12:56.480,0:13:02.880
fuzzy search. So we can just say, um, 'add-on 
information,' for instance, and it's going to do

0:13:02.880,0:13:06.320
a fuzzy search. It's going to look for the closest 
thing and have a number of results. So this will

0:13:06.320,0:13:10.640
be more like a traditional Google search, but 
still can be effective depending on where you are

0:13:10.640,0:13:15.040
within the platform. There's a link for getting 
started guides right here. There's a form to

0:13:15.040,0:13:19.760
fill out if you're having login issues here. And 
then we have our Beefree Academy. Let's go ahead

0:13:19.760,0:13:24.880
and click on Beefree Academy. If you've been to 
Beefree Academy, you know much of the information

0:13:24.880,0:13:30.640
here is geared towards our standalone app, but 
there are resources for the SDK as well. Um,

0:13:30.640,0:13:34.960
just not in the courses, but in the tutorials. 
Many of these are going to be videos that touch

0:13:34.960,0:13:41.200
on the SDK. As you see, the last spotlight session 
I was in is featured here: the SDK HTML importer

0:13:41.200,0:13:47.360
API. Um, that was really good. So SDK information 
is available in the Academy, and I'm happy to tell

0:13:47.360,0:13:55.760
you that on the planning right now is our first 
end-to-end 'Getting Started with Beefree SDK'

0:13:55.760,0:14:00.480
video series. You'll find it here as well. So 
that is in the works. I'm really excited about

0:14:00.480,0:14:04.720
that. I'm going to have a huge part to play 
along with Mark—along with Mark Amenia right

0:14:04.720,0:14:10.480
here. He is our video genius. So we have those 
things coming together for you. But tutorials,

0:14:10.480,0:14:16.640
courses, the Academy itself, and then additional 
resources are all available in Beefree Academy.

0:14:16.640,0:14:21.120
Alright, from there, let's go to the 
blog. Now, I think I can navigate to the

0:14:21.120,0:14:27.200
blog if I try hard enough. So let's just see. 
'Learn,' yes, under the 'Learn' section here,

0:14:27.200,0:14:32.960
there's another reference to the docs, tutorials, 
some customer stories, and our blog. So some of

0:14:32.960,0:14:36.720
you like to just read through, whether it's 
case studies, whether it's the latest feature

0:14:36.720,0:14:41.600
and how to use it. A lot of things with SDK that 
you can use will be featured on our blog, like

0:14:41.600,0:14:46.880
the most recent one is here, came out June 23rd, 
which was just yesterday: 'How to Empower Users

0:14:46.880,0:14:53.280
with Better Email Creation,' 'Why Choose Beefree 
SDK.' Let's take a quick little pause here. It's

0:14:53.280,0:14:57.440
interesting that I'm working at this company, and 
I really love our team and our product. Fun fact:

0:14:57.440,0:15:01.760
My very first job in the technical realm when 
I got out of the restaurant business was as

0:15:01.760,0:15:06.720
a front-end webdev in a marketing team. And one 
of the things that I was responsible for was our

0:15:06.720,0:15:13.200
sales emails. And we used, I'm not going to get 
into it, it's painful, but a very, very painful,

0:15:13.200,0:15:19.360
long, laborious solution to get emails out. So 
really, really happy to be at a modern tool,

0:15:19.360,0:15:24.240
the Beefree SDK, to allow us to do the same 
thing but in a much better way. But yeah,

0:15:24.240,0:15:29.760
'How to Empower Users with Better Email,' 
and other blogs will be found in our blog.

0:15:29.760,0:15:32.960
From there, let's go ahead and navigate to 
the YouTube page. So I'm just going to start

0:15:32.960,0:15:38.240
closing some of these up. I think I'm eating 
up a lot of resources here, but our YouTube

0:15:38.240,0:15:44.560
page is a fantastic resource, uh, for both 
Beefree the app as well as Beefree SDK. Uh,

0:15:44.560,0:15:47.520
this spotlight session you're on will 
be uploaded here, as well as all of our

0:15:47.520,0:15:52.720
spotlight sessions are available in playlists. 
You see a playlist for SDK sessions right there,

0:15:52.720,0:15:58.880
and a ton of other quick hit. Most of these 
are 10 minutes or less, specific feature and

0:15:58.880,0:16:03.200
specific problems. We like to think about problems 
and solutions. So you can probably search for

0:16:03.200,0:16:07.120
different problems you're having. Many of them you 
might even find a YouTube video to correspond to

0:16:07.120,0:16:12.720
it. So definitely check out our Beefree YouTube 
channel at your convenience. Time is flying,

0:16:12.720,0:16:16.160
I can't believe it's 11:16 already. 
We will come to the questions shortly.

0:16:16.160,0:16:22.960
So from there, let's go on to the GitHub. Our 
GitHub features 16 repositories, all made with

0:16:22.960,0:16:27.200
you in mind. Now, the popular ones we have here 
that are starred include our sample client, which

0:16:27.200,0:16:33.200
is the sample HTML client. We also have our React 
starter here. We have our ASP.NET one somewhere

0:16:33.200,0:16:40.640
in here. We have ASP.NET. There's one for Vue.js, 
excuse me, for Next.js. We have some sample forms.

0:16:40.640,0:16:45.600
We have our npm package right here. The official 
package is right here. You can check out if you

0:16:45.600,0:16:49.120
want to see behind the scenes, you're that kind 
of person, it's available for you right here. But

0:16:49.120,0:16:54.960
definitely want to check on assets, templates. A 
number of templates are available to you that you

0:16:54.960,0:17:01.440
can see right in our GitHub repository, in our 
GitHub account, including brand new as of today,

0:17:01.440,0:17:07.120
our pop-up templates. We have nine pop-up 
templates. As you see, 18 hours ago, 18 hours ago.

0:17:07.120,0:17:12.320
So this is not a repo or a collection of repos 
that's just standing there stagnant. These are

0:17:12.320,0:17:18.160
code repositories that are being updated for your 
benefit. Like, we have one called 'World Music

0:17:18.160,0:17:23.520
Day,' 'Welcome Back,' 'Nonprofit Fundraising for 
Africa,' et cetera. A few templates you can check

0:17:23.520,0:17:28.560
out on your own. I'm just going to click on 'Black 
Friday' just as a for instance. We got the HTML,

0:17:28.560,0:17:33.120
the JSON, and an image. I think that's 
pretty doggone cool. So definitely check

0:17:33.120,0:17:41.920
out the templates. They're in our GitHub, in our 
GitHub account, that you can find right here.

0:17:41.920,0:17:49.280
Alright, from there, I want to go to—and I'm 
almost finished with my portion—our Twitter page.

0:17:49.280,0:17:54.400
I'm sorry, our X page. I just can't stop saying 
Twitter! So really exciting thing happened about

0:17:54.400,0:18:03.440
two to three weeks ago: We have, at my urging, 
taken our X account and made it SDK-focused. Now,

0:18:03.440,0:18:08.160
this is important to you because as of right 
now, we don't really have a focused forum like

0:18:08.160,0:18:13.600
a Discord or a Discourse or a Slack for you 
to just nerd out with other developers about

0:18:13.600,0:18:18.400
all things Beefree SDK. Now, we do have 
a channel within the Email Geek Slack.

0:18:18.400,0:18:23.120
We invite you to join that. But in terms of 
our wholly-owned space, this would be a great

0:18:23.120,0:18:28.640
place for that. So all of these recent tweets 
are all coming from me, even the cringey GIFs,

0:18:28.640,0:18:33.520
uh, because this is all now SDK-focused. 
So feel free to jump into the comments,

0:18:33.520,0:18:38.240
ask questions, add your own comments, things 
that you're working on, not working on anymore,

0:18:38.240,0:18:41.920
things that have worked and not worked for you. 
We're working on a new banner for here as well.

0:18:41.920,0:18:49.520
This is now totally Beefree SDK-focused, 
and I'm happy to be at the helm of that.

0:18:49.520,0:18:55.440
Now, per my links on my list, that is all. So 
let's just make sure we went over them all.

0:18:55.440,0:19:00.560
First resource is myself. Feel free to connect 
with me on X and/or LinkedIn. Definitely LinkedIn

0:19:00.560,0:19:04.400
is the professional connecting site. We looked 
at the homepage. We want to go from there to the

0:19:04.400,0:19:09.760
developers page as your portal. We looked at the 
developer portal, looked at the docs page, the

0:19:09.760,0:19:17.200
support page. We looked at the Academy, the blog, 
YouTube, the GitHub repos, and of course, our

0:19:17.200,0:19:25.840
revamped X account. That leaves 11 minutes for me 
to focus on you. So let's just stop sharing real

0:19:25.840,0:19:32.720
quick. We're going to turn off picture-in-picture, 
and we will stop sharing as well. And so now we're

0:19:32.720,0:19:37.280
going to come to your questions and hear 
from you: What would you like to see in our

0:19:37.280,0:19:41.920
resources? What assets can we add? What can 
we do a little better on that front? So I'm

0:19:41.920,0:19:48.080
just going to find the first one here. Y'all give 
me just a moment. I think these are all intros.

0:19:48.080,0:19:53.120
Alright, Jeremy asked, 'Lawrence, do you typically 
join external Slack channels that Beefree

0:19:53.120,0:19:59.840
establishes with clients?' That is not something 
that I do, but I am available for that if that is

0:19:59.840,0:20:03.440
of interest. So we would like to let the clients 
be the driver for that kind of thing. Obviously,

0:20:03.440,0:20:06.960
every client is different in how they 
manage it. In some cases, it's a, 'Yes,

0:20:06.960,0:20:11.840
we want them here in the room with us working and 
collaborating with us,' and if that's available,

0:20:11.840,0:20:16.000
definitely send me an invite. I would love to 
do that. But I don't want to just invite myself

0:20:16.000,0:20:19.920
to a room I'm not invited to, because 
there may be proprietary issues, NDAs,

0:20:19.920,0:20:23.840
things of that nature. But am I available for 
that? Absolutely. I would love to get in the room

0:20:23.840,0:20:31.760
and nerd out with you. Great question, Jeremy, 
I appreciate you very much. And Samantha had

0:20:31.760,0:20:36.640
a great answer for that as well. Thank you 
for that, Samantha. Got a thumbs up there.

0:20:36.640,0:20:44.320
Josh said, 'I was going to ask about using AI with 
a Beefree email builder.' Yes, so AI, the topic of

0:20:44.320,0:20:54.400
all topics. We definitely have the, um, AI search 
here. But there's also a thing known as Simple

0:20:54.400,0:21:01.280
Schema that just might interest you, Joshua. I'm 
not going to read this to you entirely, but I will

0:21:01.280,0:21:07.200
say that Beefree JSON is our JSON schema we use 
to structure and validate designs in Beefree SDK.

0:21:07.200,0:21:12.720
It does not provide the best structure for 
training AI models. The SDK Simple Schema,

0:21:12.720,0:21:17.520
so this is a different schema that we have, is a 
lightweight alternative to our more robust JSON

0:21:17.520,0:21:25.120
that is more accessible for AI engines and humans 
as well. That said, I'm actually just finished

0:21:25.120,0:21:30.000
writing an outline for a talk that's going to 
take us from a prompt with a design all the way

0:21:30.000,0:21:36.320
to a fully fleshed out and deployed, uh, email 
that's going to be hosted in an application. Uh,

0:21:36.320,0:21:40.560
so I'm going to make sure that's recorded and get 
you—get a copy of that as well. Thanks for that

0:21:40.560,0:21:45.680
question, Joshua. And I was just showing something 
that you could not see, so let me just share that

0:21:45.680,0:21:49.440
real quick. I'm looking at the screen as if you 
can see it. You clearly cannot see it. So let's

0:21:49.440,0:21:56.240
just do that really, really quickly. I was on 
this screen right here. Sorry about that. There

0:21:56.240,0:22:02.640
we go. So Simple Schema, right? Simple Schema is 
designed for not only humans, but for AI-driven

0:22:02.640,0:22:06.800
design. So feel free to look that up. It is a data 
structure. There's a different type of JSON that

0:22:06.800,0:22:13.280
will still represent so much of the full power 
of the email that we put out on a regular basis.

0:22:13.280,0:22:17.200
Alright, stop sharing so I can see these 
questions again. Alright, thank you,

0:22:17.200,0:22:21.280
Joshua. 'Humble beginnings are always 
painful.' Absolutely, absolutely they

0:22:21.280,0:22:27.600
are. And Samantha came through once again with 
some information. Looks like that one is about,

0:22:27.600,0:22:34.080
uh, add-ons and visual builders. 
Awesome! Thank you so much for that.

0:22:34.080,0:22:38.560
Jeremy says, 'We were given a PDF 
document to document the for/coedit

0:22:38.560,0:22:43.200
endpoints. I don't see any documentation 
for those endpoints on the website. Is

0:22:43.200,0:22:51.920
that coming?' That is a great question. 
And that is for the co-edit endpoints.

0:22:51.920,0:22:58.080
And I'm going to real-time search two places. Uh,

0:22:58.080,0:23:08.880
that is the helps—so not the help center. Let's 
see here. I think it might be in documentation.

0:23:08.880,0:23:12.720
I want to drop a link here 
for you, Jeremy. Let me know,

0:23:12.720,0:23:20.480
does this address what you were going for or not? 
That is in the documentation right now. Also,

0:23:20.480,0:23:23.600
I saw an update from our technical 
writer I mentioned earlier. Let me

0:23:23.600,0:23:30.960
just search if that was mentioned for him. 
Beefree—oh, I need to fix that. Thank you.

0:23:31.680,0:23:40.560
I think that was in Beefree SDK docs. There we 
go. 'See preview changes,' 'CSS changes.' Nope,

0:23:40.560,0:23:51.200
not there. 'Saved rows,' 'hosted rows,' 'front-end 
commands,' 'check endpoints.' See, is that it?

0:23:51.200,0:23:56.480
So this is endpoints for check-in points. 
That is not what you're asking for. Alright,

0:23:56.480,0:24:00.240
just let me know, John, um, let me know if 
that was what you were asking for there.

0:24:02.800,0:24:10.320
Uh, who asked that question? Jeremy, yeah. 
Awesome questions. Thank you so much for that.

0:24:10.320,0:24:19.200
And the great thing is, okay, so you responded 
with a different one. 'Co-editing integration,

0:24:19.200,0:24:24.720
that subpage does have what I was looking for. 
Yes.' Oh, fantastic! Good, glad to hear it,

0:24:24.720,0:24:30.480
glad to hear it. Great questions from the audience 
today. Thank you all for being here. Again,

0:24:30.480,0:24:34.720
this spotlight session, if you didn't catch all 
the links, it was being recorded. It will be

0:24:34.720,0:24:38.240
uploaded to YouTube, so you don't have to try 
to jot them all down fast. Just refer to our

0:24:38.240,0:24:47.600
YouTube in a few pages or, excuse me, in a few 
days. You'll be able to see all that clearly.

0:24:47.600,0:24:53.040
Alright, closing Simple Schema. Any other 
questions? Anything you would like to see

0:24:53.040,0:24:59.120
added? What resources have you used from other 
technologies, other software companies, other

0:24:59.120,0:25:02.560
SaaS companies, you're like, 'Oh, I wish they 
had that at Beefree.' We just don't quite have

0:25:02.560,0:25:08.080
it yet. We would love to hear from you. Make note 
of that, not promising we'll turn it on next week,

0:25:08.080,0:25:11.840
but we definitely want to make note of it and 
prioritize it in terms of looking at, 'Hey, out of

0:25:11.840,0:25:16.880
all the things that we're doing, what have we been 
asked for from our user base, current and future?'

0:25:16.880,0:25:22.960
Those are the things we want to hear from. And 
indeed, the continued evolution of our developer

0:25:22.960,0:25:27.840
advocacy program. Again, I want to work for you. 
I want to be an advocate for you. So I'm going to

0:25:27.840,0:25:33.680
come up with my own videos, my own blog posts, my 
own talking topics for meetups and conferences.

0:25:33.680,0:25:37.680
But when I hear from users, 'Hey, here's what I 
actually need to help me onboard better. Here's

0:25:37.680,0:25:42.160
what'll make this process smoother for me and 
smoother for my team.' Those are the things that

0:25:42.160,0:25:47.840
pinpoint how I can write and shape the DevRel 
program. So that'll be really, really helpful.

0:25:47.840,0:25:52.240
Alright, comment from Tyson. 'Thanks for 
coming in, Tyson.' Hi Tyson from Denver,

0:25:52.240,0:25:59.280
Colorado. 'PM for my company. We're on the VPC 
version of Beefree. VPC version of Beefree. Are

0:25:59.280,0:26:05.120
all updates and features added to the VPC 
version?' That one I'm going to pass to

0:26:05.120,0:26:15.360
Samantha. I have not worked exclusively with 
the VPC version in the last three months.

0:26:15.360,0:26:21.040
But that's a very good technical question, 
nevertheless. 'VPC plan.' Alright. 'Customized

0:26:21.040,0:26:34.880
releases.' Okay, more control. So it does 
have a different release cycle. Okay, gotcha.

0:26:34.880,0:26:39.360
And you're asking, 'Does all the updates 
and features added to the VPC version?' I'm

0:26:39.360,0:26:45.760
going to have to follow up with that, so I'm 
going to get your name down, Tyson Helmick.

0:26:45.760,0:26:49.440
Do you mind just leaving the client name that 
you work with? I want to be sure I follow up

0:26:49.440,0:27:01.920
with you because top of mind, I am not sure. I 
have not worked exclusively with VPC as of yet.

0:27:01.920,0:27:08.400
Boop. Awesome.

0:27:08.400,0:27:13.360
Intapp. Awesome, got it. Thank you so much. 
You will hear back from me or one—someone on

0:27:13.360,0:27:20.800
our team within the week, hopefully me. Awesome 
sauce! Alrighty, Jeremy comes with another great

0:27:20.800,0:27:24.960
question. 'I'm looking in the API docs. Awesome. I 
think it would make sense from the perspective of

0:27:24.960,0:27:31.120
a developer to see the info in that co-editing 
integration guide in the API doc section since

0:27:31.120,0:27:36.560
it's documenting endpoints for managing co-edit 
sessions.' I got to read that again. I think what

0:27:36.560,0:27:40.160
you're saying makes sense, but let me read it 
one more time. So, 'I'm looking at the API doc

0:27:40.160,0:27:45.280
session. Got it. I think it would make sense from 
the perspective of a developer to see the info in

0:27:45.280,0:27:51.920
the co-editing integration guide in the API doc 
section.' Okay, yes. 'Since it's documenting

0:27:51.920,0:27:55.680
endpoints for managing co-edit sessions.' 
That's—that's logical. That's logical. I don't

0:27:55.680,0:28:03.760
know if there was a reason it wasn't included, but 
I would dig into that. That's quite logical to me.

0:28:03.760,0:28:08.240
Samantha, give me some additional information 
for Tyson. Thank you so much for that. Folks,

0:28:08.240,0:28:12.320
we're in our last two minutes. I'm 
bringing back to the link I posted

0:28:12.320,0:28:19.520
in that comment. Yes, you're good. I 
got you, Jeremy. I got you. All good.

0:28:19.520,0:28:23.040
Last two minutes. What would you like to see? 
Hey, here's a question. First, let me ask a direct

0:28:23.040,0:28:30.320
question. Shortly before I started, we had a 
forum. A forum, it was where the developers came,

0:28:30.320,0:28:35.120
like I like to say, and nerded out. It was our 
playground. The engagement was a little low,

0:28:35.120,0:28:38.720
right? There were some people who were engaging, 
but not many. And there was an executive decision

0:28:38.720,0:28:44.160
made to close that down. And so right now, the 
main forum would be the X account. How many of

0:28:44.160,0:28:50.800
you who are here are interested in a forum of 
some type outside of X/Twitter? Be it a Discord,

0:28:50.800,0:28:55.360
a Slack, a Discourse, or some other format. Is 
there any interest there? Or any other way that

0:28:55.360,0:29:00.480
you like to engage with fellow developers 
who are working in an ecosystem? I would

0:29:00.480,0:29:06.480
love to hear from you, or are you good 
as is? That's valuable feedback as well.

0:29:19.280,0:29:26.800
Just see one person typing.

0:29:26.800,0:29:31.120
Ryan Hagen, I got your message. Thank you so much.

0:29:33.120,0:29:37.600
The notification from the moderator side is 
a tiny, tiny red dot. I've been overlooking

0:29:37.600,0:29:45.920
that for I don't know how long now, but 
I do see your message. Thank you so much.

0:29:45.920,0:29:51.120
'Don't use extra social media.' I don't blame you. 
'So Slack or a forum would be preferable to me.

0:29:51.120,0:29:54.800
It remains to be seen how much I would actually 
interact with that, though.' Hey, honest answer,

0:29:54.800,0:30:00.320
I appreciate that. And again, perhaps closing that 
down made sense. People are getting what they need

0:30:00.320,0:30:04.400
either through documentation, through GitHub 
repos, or other sources. So if that's the case,

0:30:04.400,0:30:08.320
that is perfectly fine. I just wanted 
to check because I tend to spend way too

0:30:08.320,0:30:14.880
much time online in Slacks and Discords for every 
conceivable thing: for cloud, for React, for Java,

0:30:14.880,0:30:20.480
for you name it, I'm in some Discord or Slack. 
And so if that was an interest from our community,

0:30:20.480,0:30:24.080
our Beefree SDK community, I definitely 
wanted to hear that. And if not, we will

0:30:24.080,0:30:30.240
keep it as my mother would say, we're going to 
keep it trucking. I have 11:30 Central time,

0:30:30.240,0:30:34.560
folks. So I see one more person typing. 
I think it might have been Joshua,

0:30:34.560,0:30:38.000
so I'm going to allow for that, and then we're 
going to go ahead and wrap up for the day. Thank

0:30:38.000,0:30:43.360
you so much for all the interaction, the great 
questions and feedback from Tyson. Thank you,

0:30:43.360,0:30:47.840
Sam. 'Yes, sign up for the updates and use 
our Slack channel extensively. Dev team

0:30:47.840,0:30:51.280
works a lot with Lorenzo.' Awesome. 'Just 
wanted to know if you develop and release

0:30:51.280,0:30:56.880
features for the VPC in addition to your 
core offering.' Awesome, awesome, awesome.

0:30:58.960,0:31:04.160
Alright, well, I don't see anyone else typing. 
Joshua, 'I also think it depends on the developer

0:31:04.160,0:31:09.120
audience. I like the docs and communicating 
directly.' That makes sense. Thanks a lot, man,

0:31:09.120,0:31:14.560
appreciate that. Folks, thank you for coming 
to the session today, whether you're live

0:31:14.560,0:31:17.840
or you're seeing us later on YouTube. Again, 
my name is Lawrence Lockhart. I'm the Senior

0:31:17.840,0:31:22.400
Developer Advocate, and I am happy to interact 
with you via whatever means that you like,

0:31:22.400,0:31:26.480
whether it's LinkedIn or social media. Uh, talk 
about what's going well and what you'd like to

0:31:26.480,0:31:30.800
see better. And hey, if we want to have some 
special webinars, tell me about it. If you want

0:31:30.800,0:31:34.720
to have maybe a sponsor a meetup in your town, 
there's a ton of email developers where you live,

0:31:34.720,0:31:38.160
for whatever reason, can we have an email 
meetup group? Let's talk about that kind

0:31:38.160,0:31:42.480
of thing. I'll flow out to you, have us a 
great time. So until then, you all keep on

0:31:42.480,0:31:47.113
producing those beautiful emails with Beefree 
SDK and tell a friend about us. Thanks a lot!
