The following text includes the complete transcript for this video.

```
1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,920
Welcome, everyone! Today, we'll be discussing how 
email templates can drive business expansion and

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,760
help you gain a competitive edge without all 
the effort. Before we get into introductions,

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,920
I want to take a quick moment to orient you to 
the Livestorm app interface. On the bottom right

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,760
of your screen, you have options to interact 
with our live polls, questions, and chat during

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,480
the session. I'll do my best to address any 
questions as they come up, but rest assured,

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:29,200
we'll have time at the end for an active Q&A, and 
we'll make sure we get to everybody's questions.

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,640
So, getting started, I'm your host, my 
name is Jesse. I'm a Sales Engineer on

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,600
the SDK Sales and Customer Success 
Team. Joining me today are experts

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,440
from our Product and Engineering Teams, 
who I'll ask to introduce themselves.

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,120
Francesca: Thanks, Jesse! Hi, everyone, I'm 
Francesca. I'm a Senior Product Marketing

11
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,040
Manager working on Beefree SDK. Thank you 
so much for making the time for us today.

12
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:59,000
Roberto: Hi, everyone, my name is Roberto, and 
I'm a Senior Backend Developer. I work among many

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,520
other projects on the Template Catalog API. Thank 
you for having me, and I'm excited to be here.

14
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,400
After today's session, we hope you take away 
a deeper understanding of the Template Catalog

15
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,920
API and what it can do for your users. In 
the end, we want to make it actionable so

16
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,440
you can follow a clear path forward and take 
advantage of these benefits in your business.

17
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:23,040
As a bit of background about us, Beefree offers an 
email, landing page, and popup builder that people

18
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,040
really love. Beefree SDK, the solution we're 
presenting here, enables SaaS applications to

19
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,640
give their users a seamless content creation 
experience. The toolkit includes editable,

20
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,320
white-label, no-code builders for emails, 
landing pages, and popups. Additionally,

21
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,000
it provides a range of components, APIs, and 
support services to seamlessly integrate the

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,760
content creation workflow into any application. 
We enable SaaS applications that go from proof

23
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,480
of concept to production in days or weeks 
instead of years, with low maintenance costs,

24
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,120
reliable technology that scales automatically, 
and is very secure. For the security-minded,

25
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:03,360
safety is a top priority, and 
Beefree SDK is ISO 27001 certified.

26
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,680
Now available in the SDK is a template catalog 
that was originally born in our hosted app with

27
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,160
the help of 35 designers from 15 countries. After 
release, we moved the hosted app to a freemium

28
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,200
strategy early last year, making our template 
catalog free to all users. By the end of the year,

29
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:24,280
we celebrated milestones like passing 365,000 
emails and landing pages created from a template

30
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,440
in a single month. So, what started as 
a small effort with a few designers has

31
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:36,440
evolved into a workflow that's produced 1,600 
high-performing templates for our Beefree users.

32
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,760
However, a real problem emerged on the SDK 
side when our customers received static

33
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,360
designs that didn't age well. As we develop 
new technology and design practices evolved,

34
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,640
the templates weren't keeping up. Our 
design team would prepare template assets,

35
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,440
and we would share static files appropriate 
for that point in time. When looking at how

36
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,320
we can better use templates to support our SDK 
customers and, in turn, add value for your users,

37
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:07,000
we first looked at how our own template 
catalog benefits our self-hosted product.

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,400
One thing was clear: users prefer to start 
with a template. In fact, from our experience,

39
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,160
about 64% of new designs begin from a template, 
and that's from a significant sample size of over

40
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:23,240
three million emails and landing pages designed 
in Beefree over the past 12 months. We've also

41
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,400
received a lot of feedback from users of our 
public catalog. A communications manager at a

42
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:33,120
medium-sized business told us how templates made 
it easier to navigate brand changes, and a VP at

43
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,160
a real estate company liked how collaborative 
it was for them to update their templates. This

44
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,760
reminds me of the value of operating at scale. 
There's a strong business case to highlight where

45
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,760
the toolkit makes it easy for you to charge 
your users for access to standard templates,

46
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,240
allowing them to customize and save elements, thus 
operating at scale. By always having a robust and

47
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:58,200
growing template catalog filled with seasonally 
appropriate or vertically distributed offerings,

48
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,280
you can reduce the onboarding process for your 
customers. You can get them to experience value

49
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,480
in your application faster, which leads to 
higher conversion and happier customers.

50
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,120
Okay, so now that you've heard my sales pitch, 
let's talk with the experts and ask about the

51
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,920
details regarding the template catalog. Francesca, 
is it okay for you to start from the top? I'd love

52
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,840
to hear from you and from a product perspective, 
how would you describe the Template Catalog API?

53
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,800
Francesca: Thanks, Jesse. Thanks for this 
introduction, very valuable. Okay, I'm going

54
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:32,440
to answer this in a very straightforward way. 
So, the Template Catalog API helps you create a

55
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:39,960
personalized template catalog for emails or pages 
within your SaaS application. By using the API,

56
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:46,840
essentially, you can integrate a wide range of 
templates that we keep constantly up to date

57
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:53,360
inside your application. We design templates 
by the type of industry, by the type of usage,

58
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:01,200
even seasonal events during the year, and so 
forth. So, ultimately, by using this API, you'll

59
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:09,200
be able to offer your end-users a truly enhanced 
design experience within your own platform.

60
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,520
Jesse: But why SDK customers? What were 
the challenges we wanted to solve for them?

61
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,880
Francesca: Well, what we noticed is that our 
SDK customers are always looking for new ways to

62
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:27,080
promote user engagement within their platform. But 
if you think about it, if you do this on your own,

63
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:35,440
then the challenges can be so many. In the 
case of design templates, if you want to offer

64
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,880
inspirational templates to your customers, to your 
end-users, this means you have to invest time and

65
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:48,440
resources into a full creative process. You can 
do this with internal or external designers,

66
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:54,280
and then potentially, you need to survey your 
end-users to understand their current tastes,

67
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,800
their current preferences, and so on. 
Then, you need to invest in development

68
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:05,200
to integrate the creative assets within 
your application. And then, of course,

69
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:11,720
once you have done that, you also have to keep 
those assets up to date because design trends keep

70
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:18,040
changing, and so do user needs. So, it's quite 
complicated if you want to do it on your own.

71
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:24,500
Jesse: It does sound like a lot of work. Are you 
able to show us exactly what you're referring to?

72
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:33,360
Francesca: Yeah, sure, just let me share 
my screen. Okay, one second, perfect. Okay,

73
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,880
so what I'm showing you right now, this is our 
own implementation of the SDK API within our

74
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:46,400
hosted app. And this is just an example 
of how you could leverage this template

75
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:53,840
catalog within your application, but be mindful 
that you can actually customize the branding or

76
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,800
the style according to your needs and to what 
you need to show within your application. So,

77
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:07,120
like I said, this is how we did it inside our 
hosted app. We provide some options at the top,

78
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:13,800
some promotion options at the top, and then on 
the left side, we have all our categories. The

79
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,640
categories are so many because we can serve so 
many industries and use cases. So, for example,

80
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:31,600
we have use cases here, we have email or page 
templates for seasonal events, which are many.

81
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:37,920
And then, lastly, we have also templates for 
automations for e-commerce, for example. And

82
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:43,280
last but not least, industries. We serve so many 
industries, so really there is a template for

83
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:53,400
every need. And then, what you can do, okay, in 
the main area here, you will have your catalog,

84
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:59,040
and this will show the templates to your users. 
And then, we've also added an overlay here,

85
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:04,000
and then by clicking Edit, this will open the 
template that you've chosen inside the builder,

86
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,040
and then you can start customizing it essentially. 
So, like I said, this is just how we did it

87
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:14,280
inside our hosted app by leveraging the 
SDK API, and this is just an example,

88
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,640
and I wanted to show you this because it's pretty 
clear, it's pretty neat, and it works very well

89
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:24,700
for us. But like I said, then Roberto will also 
show you what you can customize within this.

90
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:29,560
Jesse: That's helpful, thank you. So, what exactly 
is the difference between the Template Catalog

91
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,720
API and the free template catalog 
on Beefree that you just showed us?

92
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:39,080
Francesca: Okay, so Beefree is a 
hosted app for designers or marketers,

93
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:46,240
and it uses the same Beefree SDK toolkit 
available to our SaaS customers. So,

94
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:54,980
the template workflow on Beefree, which we've just 
seen, is powered by the Beefree SDK Template API.

95
00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:03,520
Jesse: Got it. Okay, so one template library, it's 
regularly updated. How often are they updated?

96
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:09,240
Francesca: The catalog will be updated with the 
latest trends by our design community at no extra

97
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,200
charge. We're very committed to providing 
fresh new templates, and this happens every

98
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:20,720
quarter. On a technical side, from a technical 
perspective, all templates are always designed

99
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,600
using an up-to-date version of the SDK. So, 
this means if there are new features, then the

100
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:32,120
templates will integrate those new features 
as soon as they are released. In addition,

101
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,980
we have reprocessed many templates to convert 
discontinued features to the newest versions.

102
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,320
Jesse: Very cool. Is there anything 
they need before they get started?

103
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,880
Francesca: Yes, well, it's very simple. 
So, in order to leverage this API, firstly,

104
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:53,680
you need to be a Beefree SDK customer on 
a Core Plan or a higher plan. And then you

105
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,320
have to activate a yearly subscription 
through the SDK Customer Success Team:

106
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:07,040
Tyler, Kyle, Marina, or Leah, our colleagues. 
So, it's very, very simple, and right away,

107
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:14,000
you will be able to leverage the API and to show 
this fantastic catalog to your end-users. Now,

108
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,080
talking about the catalog and implementation, 
now Roberto can actually show us what happens

109
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:25,260
after the subscription is activated. So, Roberto, 
can you please give us a demo of implementation?

110
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:35,720
Roberto: Yes, let me share my screen. Okay, 
now here we are in the Beefree SDK console.

111
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:42,800
This is the detailed page for an application 
that I've built on purpose for this demo. So,

112
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,920
as a customer, you need to generate a Content 
Service API key like this one I'm highlighting

113
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:59,440
now. And after the generation, reach out to your 
Customer Success Manager to activate it and to

114
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:07,440
completely set up. They will guide you through the 
process and answer any questions you have. Once

115
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:16,960
you have the API activated, you can use it to send 
requests to the API endpoints. I will now show you

116
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:28,920
some requests I've prepared as examples. You can 
find all the technical information by going to our

117
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:43,000
website, developers.beefree.io, and just click on 
Resources and then on Docs. Okay, so here on Docs,

118
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:56,080
you have to scroll down until you find the Content 
Service API and Template Catalog API. Here you can

119
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:05,520
find all the technical documentation. You can 
find a brief explanation how to activate it,

120
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:12,320
how to use the authorization header you need, 
the host name you need to send the request,

121
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:21,400
all the parameters and the endpoint 
that you can use when calling the APIs.

122
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:31,480
So, just a moment, I will share another… I'm 
stopping this screen sharing, I'm now sharing

123
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:48,360
another program. It's a simple Go client 
where I can show you that, for example,

124
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:55,720
this is the main endpoint of the API. The host 
name is api.beefree.io, and this is the path,

125
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:05,360
/catalog/templates. In the header section, I need 
to fill the authorization header with the token I

126
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:13,120
have generated in the developer console. And 
when I hit Send, I get the response from the

127
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:21,360
server. This is in JSON format. As you can see, we 
have a list of all the templates in the catalog.

128
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:31,680
There are 1,600, more than 1,600. Here we have 
a list, the response is paginated. We have the

129
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:42,120
details for the templates, the main, all the main 
information about the template. I can also call

130
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:51,400
the detail endpoint. So, for example, I put in the 
URL the slug of the template, and when I hit Send,

131
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:59,040
I get the response of this specific template. In 
this detailed response, we have all the general

132
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:06,480
information like before in the list, but we 
have also the HTML data, so the entire HTML

133
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:17,360
that you can use to build the preview, and also 
the JSON format that is the format that is used,

134
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:28,240
as you know, by the editor. So, you can pass this 
JSON data to the editor to open the template and

135
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:36,840
edit it inside the editor. We have an endpoint 
that lists all the categories that are present.

136
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:44,880
We have another endpoint that lists all the 
collections. We have an endpoint to list all

137
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:52,040
the designers because each template is made 
by one of our designers, and you can get also

138
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:58,320
details about a single designer. For example, 
now I'm calling the API, as you can see, for our

139
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:10,280
Luana, who is a designer in Beefree, and we can 
have some brief description, we can have an image

140
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:17,520
of Luana, we can have all the information 
we need. There's an endpoint to list all the

141
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:29,160
tags present in the catalog. And the interesting 
thing is that in the main endpoints, but in every

142
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:36,840
point, but specifically in the main is the place 
where these things is more useful, let's say,

143
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:43,680
you can filter templates. You can filter by, for 
example, tag. I can call the endpoint /templates,

144
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:50,360
and here in the query string, I can say 
that I want to filter all the templates

145
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:59,120
that have the "luxury" tag. And when I send the 
request, I see that we have eight templates that

146
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:05,880
have this tag. I can filter for category, for 
example, here, same. The format is the same,

147
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:13,680
just use the parameter category, and there's a 
category called "Welcome." And when I issue the

148
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:19,360
request, I see that there are 22 templates in 
this category, and here is the list of all the

149
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:29,080
templates. And I can also perform searches. If 
I use the parameter search, I can then insert

150
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:36,280
terms separated by a comma. In this example, 
I'm searching for all the templates with the

151
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:44,640
word "Black Friday." When I send, I get back 
the response from the server, and we have 23

152
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:52,640
templates that have the words "Black Friday" 
in the description or in the body. Basically,

153
00:16:53,360 --> 00:17:01,040
these are the main points, and as I told you, 
there's an entire page in our documentation that

154
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:08,640
lists all the endpoints and all the parameters 
that you can use to filter templates. You can

155
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:16,240
filter it by publication date, by categories, 
by tag, by a free search. There are really

156
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:27,220
a lot of different ways to do it. Okay, 
I'll stop my screen sharing and get back.

157
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:34,840
Jesse: Okay, thank you, Roberto. If you have any 
kind of question, I'm here. Perfect, thank you,

158
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,160
Roberto. So, we do have one question, 
I'll get to it in just one moment,

159
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,600
but before I do, I want to spend one minute 
talking about pricing. Previously, you promoted,

160
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:48,000
and you still offer, packs of 30 templates 
for $1,000 USD delivered as static files,

161
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,720
serving a single purpose. The API offers much 
more value: a $2,000 annual subscription gives

162
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,240
you complete access to our growing template 
catalog, so more than 1,600 templates for

163
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,000
you and your users to choose from, which are 
growing in volume and expanding in purpose.

164
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,720
Sign up for the yearly subscription, connect 
the API, and let's grow engagement together.

165
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,880
Alright, so we're on the last chapter of our show, 
Q&A. We do have one question here from Devon:

166
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:18,440
"Is it possible for me to add templates to the 
catalog that only my account has access to?"

167
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:28,760
Roberto: Not at the moment. At the moment, 
this API is read-only, let's say. It's our full

168
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:38,440
catalog of templates, and they are 
in read-only. So, we are in charge

169
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:49,120
of updating and adding new templates. But 
I don't know, maybe we can ask our Product

170
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,300
Manager if this feature would be interesting 
for the future. Maybe not at the moment.

171
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,800
Jesse: Thank you, Roberto. We'll definitely do 
that. We have some product folks on the call

172
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:04,120
or the session today as well, so I'm sure we'll 
get in touch. Another question that's commonly

173
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:11,320
asked is, "Are there other features to the SDK 
that help enhance the Template Catalog API?"

174
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:18,840
Francesca: Yes, actually that's a great question, 
we get asked a lot. And the answer is yes. So,

175
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:25,280
we recently launched two new features that 
you can use and leverage to enhance the UX of

176
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:31,200
templates. The first one is the Multi-Language 
Templates feature, which essentially empowers

177
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,440
your users to design customized experiences for 
international audiences. So, your end-users will

178
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:43,800
be able to select one default language and up 
to three translations reflected in the top bar

179
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:49,960
of their builder. So, essentially, this feature 
helps you with it; it provides you with the means

180
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:57,680
to translate template content. And then, lastly, 
we have a whole bunch of features revolving around

181
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:05,720
AI because AI is a key part of our strategy at 
Beefree. We created a dedicated product team

182
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:14,680
for AI only. Early this year, we launched one 
integration with OpenAI. Your users essentially

183
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:22,000
can write engaging copy titles for their emails 
or pages in literally no time. And then we're

184
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,680
constantly expanding and researching about new AI 
features. We're just about to release AI-powered

185
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:35,200
alt text for images, so that you won't waste any 
time indexing all your images within your pages,

186
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:42,120
and that's very, very helpful. It helps you save 
time. And the integration with OpenAI is very,

187
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:49,860
very cool. It gives you some proper engaging copy 
for your copy or your paragraphs and your images.

188
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:55,120
Jesse: Very cool, thank you so much. 
Does the host application get notified,

189
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:00,520
or is there a trigger or search function 
as new templates are added to the catalog?

190
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:06,280
Roberto: There's a search function because 
one of the... if you look at the docs,

191
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:19,160
one of the parameters you can use allows you to 
filter by publication date, so you can have only

192
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:28,520
the more recent templates and searching for the 
new, more recent template. And so you can build

193
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:38,600
your logic around this feature. There's 
not a trigger on the service side,

194
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,160
but you can build it leveraging this feature.

195
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:47,960
Jesse: What does CDN usage look like 
for hosting the Template Catalog API?

196
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:55,520
Roberto: The CDN usage for the 
templates in the API are...

197
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:08,660
all the images are served by Beefree 
CDN, so there is no usage cost for this.

198
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,511
Jesse: And to confirm, to obtain the 
1600+ templates is $2,000 USD annually?

199
00:22:12,511 --> 00:22:13,720
Roberto: Yes, that is confirmed.

200
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:18,160
Jesse: Lisa asks, "How do we create the new 
templates for our use and put them in our

201
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:23,760
Dev console application platform?" This is 
a question similar to the one we had before.

202
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:35,480
Roberto: At the moment, this template, this API, 
sorry, is read-only. Maybe one can build their own

203
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:44,360
solution to integrate with the templates we serve 
from the Template Catalog API. An integrator, and

204
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:57,120
not an application, can build a parallel solution. 
It's not, at least, it's not maybe the easiest

205
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,200
thing to do, but it's not that hard. I think 
it requires some development and some effort.

206
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,080
Jesse: That is a wrap, folks! Thanks 
you so much for joining us today. We

207
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,160
will be sending the replay along with some 
additional resources shortly. We hope you

208
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,440
have a wonderful weekend, and thank 
you for spending time with us today.
