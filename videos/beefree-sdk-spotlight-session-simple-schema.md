## Beefree SDK Spotlight Session: Simple Schema

Learn how to use Simple Schema to create Beefree designs programmatically—outside of the builder. This session covers how to generate designs using your own AI tools and Simple Schema, convert them to full JSON via the /simple-to-full-json API endpoint, and load them into the builder for editing.

We’ll also explore what headless design creation means and how it opens up new possibilities for developers building custom workflows with the Beefree SDK.
