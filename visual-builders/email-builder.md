# Email Builder

## Introduction

Beefree SDK’s embeddable no-code email builder offers a solution that empowers creators to design visually striking, high-converting emails with ease. By removing technical barriers, it enables teams to build, customize, and launch campaigns faster, maximizing results without the need for hard coding. This allows marketers, designers, and content creators to focus more on designing and refining their email strategies, rather than spending time coding emails from scratch.

Email marketing remains one of the most effective digital channels, delivering an impressive [ROI of 3600%](https://www.litmus.com/blog/infographic-the-roi-of-email-marketing)—for every $1 spent, businesses see an average return of $36. In a landscape where personalization and quick execution are critical, no-code email builders like Beefree SDK make it easier for teams to create and optimize these high-performing, targeted campaigns. Personalized campaigns, which [boost click-through rates by 28.57%](https://www.sender.net/blog/email-marketing-statistics/), are more easily executed with tools that free teams from coding, allowing them to concentrate on strategy and design. By simplifying the email creation process, Beefree SDK enables creators to spend less time on technical tasks and more time driving results through impactful, strategic designs.

### What is the Email builder?

The email builder within Beefree SDK is a no-code drag-and-drop editor that enables end users to design beautiful emails that resonate with their audiences. Within the email builder, end users have access to both simple email creation tools, such as adding content blocks, and advanced email creation tools, such as dynamic content, merge tags, display conditions, html blocks, and so on. Beefree SDK’s email builder was created with email marketers, copywriters, designers, and other content creators in mind. It provides them with an environment to intuitively create emails without having to write a single line of code, while being able to easily export their design’s HTML code if they ever need it. Overall, Beefree SDK’s email builder democratizes the email creation process by providing a no-code route for your application’s end users to create visually stunning and appealing emails for their audiences.
