# Toolbar options

In the Toolbar Options tab you can:

* control individual settings that affect the top toolbar in the builder
* decide whether to hide the toolbar completely

The toolbar contains all the actions not related directly with content edition, like save, send a test or preview.

You can decide the inner elements from it, from hiding our brand to removing the save button, to create the builder version that better fits in your application.

Not enough? Remove the toolbar completely and offer all the actions with your own UI elements.

For example, in our MailUp App for Shopify, we hide the toolbar completely and control the builder (Show preview, Send test, Save) from buttons in the app UI (not in the builder). Here is how it looks.

If you decide to go this route, use the methods from this page to control the builder from your UI.
