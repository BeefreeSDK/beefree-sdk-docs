# Custom JavaScript Libraries Injection

## Custom JavaScript

Enterprise customers can request to inject external JavaScript libraries, like FullStory or Heap, into Beefree SDK when the integration is initialized as part of the [server-side configuration](../getting-started/installation/).&#x20;

Custom JavaScript requires a complete technical evaluation by the Beefree SDK development team. The assessment will undergo security, technical and compatibility assessments. &#x20;

The enterprise agreement does not cover the integration of external JavaScript libraries. It requires an addendum part of our regular terms of service.

## How it Works

Contact our Sales team and ask to run a script to get started with custom JS libraries injection. Once you contact us, we will take the following steps to complete your request:

1. Our representative will forward your request to our development team &#x20;
2. The development team will review the script and approve it within five business days
3. The script is enabled by our development team
