* Disclaimer (e.g. age verification)
* Registration (e.g. events, gated content)
* Newsletter subscription
* Customer survey

* Portfolio

They can also create fantastic one page websites, i.e. sites where all the content usually spread in different pages fits nicely into an easy-to-scroll page, complete with menu and anchors to navigate it.
