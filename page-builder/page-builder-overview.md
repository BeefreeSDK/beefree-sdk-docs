### Building web pages with Beefree SDK <a href="#building-web-pages-with-beefree-sdk" id="building-web-pages-with-beefree-sdk"></a>

Beefree SDK Page Builder will help your customers create beautiful, responsive landing pages, complete with forms and embedded videos. Combined with our **Email Builder**, you’ll have the power to deliver to your customers a **single, optimized user experience** for designing both emails and web pages.

With the Page Builder, your customers can create landing pages and one page sites with

In addition, you will find exclusive features that make sense for web pages, such as forms, embedded videos, and the ability to paste scripts, like an embeddable SurveyMonkey or Typeform survey.

Here are a few examples of web pages your customers can build with :

*
  * Product showcase or teaser
  * Disclaimer (e.g. age verification)
  * Registration (e.g. events, gated content)
  * Newsletter subscription
  * Customer survey
  * Booking request
  * Portfolio

They can also create fantastic one page websites, i.e. sites where all the content usually spread in different pages fits nicely into an easy-to-scroll page, complete with menu and anchors to navigate it.

We are constantly improving the user experience: we see the **Page Builder** as a long-term, ongoing project at .

### Testing and integrating the Page Builder <a href="#testing-and-integrating-the-page-builder" id="testing-and-integrating-the-page-builder"></a>

When you create an application in the [Beefree SDK Console](https://dam.beefree.io/devmain), you’ll be asked to select either Page or Email Builder. Paid applications allow you to create child development applications, to ease new feature testing, development, and maintenance.

Page and Email builders **share the same core functionalities**, including authentication and configuration. If you already integrated our Email builder, you can re-use most of your work by using the **same configuration and callbacks**. If this is your first approach to our builders, just follow the [Getting Started](https://docs.beefree.io/initializing-bee-plugin/) section in our documentation. All the documentation in this site applies to both products, except where noted.

All builders are available to Beefree SDK customers under the same [**all-in-one pricing.**](https://dam.beefree.io/pluginpricing) Please contact your Customer Success Manager for more details.

### The experience <a href="#the-experience" id="the-experience"></a>

We aim to provide the foundations needed to build a delightful page building experience. We started with the basic features that are already provided to design awesome email messages and tweaked them to work for Web pages.

Once launched as **Page Builder**, an application will have a few but noticeable differences from the Email builder experience:

* **width** for pages can be expanded up to **1440px;**
* the stage can be scrolled **horizontally;**
* the **sidebar** can be **collapsed** to provide more workspace – useful when working with larger widths;
* there’s a new **6-columns row** layout, to take advantage of larger widths;
* the **preview** includes viewport resize, to **test responsiveness** on various screen sizes;
* the **HTML block** allows using scripts, for improved compatibility with embedded content like surveys. This also includes Javascript, although it cannot be executed within the builder.

If you’re **on a paid plan**, you will also get support for **forms** and **embedded videos**.

* You can **define and pass forms** to the builder, and use the form content block to **retrieve and style** those forms.
* You can use the **video** content block to **embed** and **playback** videos hosted on Youtube and Vimeo, or point to a hosted video in MP4 format.
