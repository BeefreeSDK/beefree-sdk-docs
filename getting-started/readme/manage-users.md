# Manage Users

## Manage users in the Console <a href="#manage-users-in-the-console" id="manage-users-in-the-console"></a>

You can invite additional users to your Beefree SDK Console. To do so, select **Manage users** from the personal menu in the top right corner of the screen.

The user that initially created the account is identified as the **Account Owner** and can add users from this page.

Additional users will be identified as **Admins**.

**Note:** It's currently not possible to limit which applications users can see within the Developer Console.
{% endhint %}

The **Account Owner** has the following additional privileges, compared to **Admins**:

* Add, edit or delete users, as described above.
* Turn on [two-factor authentication](installation/set-up-two-factor-authentication.md), using tokens provided by mobile apps like Google Authenticator or Authy. 2FA can be enabled either for specific users, or account-wide from the **Settings & Security** section in the personal area ([learn how to set up 2FA for your account](installation/set-up-two-factor-authentication.md)).
* Change the companyâ€™s name, also in **Settings & Security**_._
