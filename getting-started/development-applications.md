# Development Applications

## Development Applications

Development applications are available with any Beefree SDK paid plan.

### What is a Development Application?

A development application is a child application that is linked to your parent application within the Beefree SDK console. The purpose of these child applications is to create development, QA, or any other type of applications that you can merge your application’s changes to prior to pushing them to production. This empowers you to test new features, even on a higher plan, within a controlled environment prior to releasing them to your application’s end users.

## How to Create a Development Application

You can create a development application within your Beefree SDK console. Prior to creating a development application, ensure you have a paid plan with Beefree SDK. This will make the functionality accessible to you.

To create a development application, take the following steps:

1. Log in to your [Beefree SDK Developer Console](https://developers.beefree.io/accounts/login/?next=/subscriptions/)

2. Create a new application

3. Navigate to your dashboard where the new application is located
4. Click the **+** next to **Add a development instance**

5. Type in the name of your development application, for example “development environment” or “QA environment”

6. Click **Create**
7. View the new development application available in your Beefree SDK dashboard

## Benefits of Development Applications

There are multiple benefits to utilizing development applications. A few of these benefits are the following:

* Merge and test changes to your application prior to releasing them to your end users
* Create an environment for different contributors in your development cycle, for example QA Engineers, frontend developers, backend developers, and so on
* Access next tier Beefree SDK features in your development applications without any additional costs
* Create as many child development applications linked to your parent production environment as you’d like  &#x20;

## Important Considerations

While access to next tier Beefree SDK features in your development applications is available to you, it is important to remember that you cannot push any next tier features in your development application to your production environment. Your production environment should only include the features reflected in your current plan subscription. If you find that you would like to push a next tier feature from your development application to your production application, you need to upgrade to the subscription plan that corresponds to those features.

Beefree SDK allows you to access next tier features within your development application to test them out and see if they are a good fit for your application’s needs. However, it is important to consider that if you plan to push those features to your production environment, that you have the right subscription and permissions to do so.

Development apps inherit the same plan that your production app is on. If you wish to test features that are available on a higher plan, go the application details and click “CHANGE PLAN” in the upper right.
