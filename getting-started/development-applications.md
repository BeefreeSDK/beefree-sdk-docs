#### Production vs. development apps <a href="#production-vs-development-apps" id="production-vs-development-apps"></a>

What you just created is your production application: you will use those application credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) in your production environment.

For development purposes, you may wish to create a **development application**. If you’re on a paid plan, you can do so easily by clicking on _Add a development version_ below any production application. You can create multiple development apps, for different purposes (e.g. QA, staging, testing new features, etc.).

Development apps inherit the same plan that your production app is on. If you wish to test features that are available on a higher plan, go the application details and click “CHANGE PLAN” in the upper right.
