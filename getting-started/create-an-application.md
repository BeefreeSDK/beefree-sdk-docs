# Create an Application

## Create an Application

The first step to embedding Beefree’s visual builders in your software is to[ sign up for a Beefree SDK account](https://developers.beefree.io/accounts/signup/). Once that’s done, you will be able to [log into the Beefree SDK Console](https://developers.beefree.io/accounts/login/).  That’s where you will:

* Create applications (e.g. an email builder and a landing page builder).
* Create development apps for all sorts of dev, QA, or staging environments.
* Configure them with both server-side and client-side configurations.

Whenever you create a new application, we will ask you to provide some general information so that they are easily recognizable for you in the Console. This only takes a few moments.

For each application, we will also provide you with a **Client ID** and **Client secret**, which you will use for authentication when you initialize it.
